# Languages
### Javascript
It's my first language. I started learning it in 2020. Still using it daily at work and for my personals projects.

### Typescript
When i gained more experience in developpement, I understood that a static typing language is better to maintain big projects. Since that day, TS become a friend of mine :).

### PHP
I couldn't ignore it.

### Rust
I'd learned Rust recently. Amazing experience with this language. Just two words : try it !
